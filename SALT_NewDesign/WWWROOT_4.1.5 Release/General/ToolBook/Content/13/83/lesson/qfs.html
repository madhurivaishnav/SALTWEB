<h3>Quick Fact Sheet – AML/CTF Programs</h3>


<p><b>What is an AML/CTF Program?</b></p>
<p>From 12 December 2007, your organisation must have an AML/CTF Program.</p>
<p>Part A of the AML/CTF Program must have as its primary purpose, the identification, management and mitigation of its ML/TF risk.</p>
<p>Part B of the AML/CTF Program must set out the applicable customer identification and verification procedures to be followed by you and your organisation in identifying customers.</p>
<p>You cannot commence to provide a designated service to a customer after 12 December 2007 if your organisation has not adopted and does not maintain an AML/CTF Program.</p>
<p><b>What is money laundering/terrorism financing ("ML/TF") risk?</b></p>
<p>ML/TF risk is the risk your organisation may reasonably face that the provision of its designated services might (whether inadvertently or otherwise) involve or facilitate money laundering or the financing of terrorism.</p>
<p>In determining ML/TF risk, your organisation must consider the risk posed by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>types of customers it has;</p></li>
<li><p>types of designated services it provides;</p></li>
<li><p>methods of delivering its designated services; and</p></li>
<li><p>foreign jurisdictions with which it deals.</p></li></ul>
<p><b>What are your obligations in relation to complying with your organisations AML/CTF Program?</p></b>
<p>It is your obligation to comply with the requirements and procedures of your organisation's AML/CTF Program to the extent that it is relevant to your role and duties.</p>


<p><b>Civil and Criminal Penalties</b></p>
<p>It is important that you and your organisation comply with your AML/CTF obligations as there are civil and criminal penalty provisions for breaches of the AML/CTF Act. Failure to comply can attract civil penalties of up $11 million imposed on a company (for example, your organisation), or up to $2.2 million on an individual (i.e. you!). A breach in particular circumstances can attract a criminal penalty of up to 4 years imprisonment as well as a fine.</p>
