					<h3>Environmental offences</h3>
					
<b><p>What is an environmental offence?</b></p>
<p>An environmental offence is generally any action (or failure to take action) which breaches the RMA. This may be a breach of a resource consent condition, undertaking an activity without a necessary consent or an unlawful discharge of contaminants into the environment. Environmental offences are mostly criminal offences. </p>
 
<b><p>What if you didn’t mean to do it?</b></p>
<p>It often does not matter. Many environmental offences do not require proof that you intended to breach the law or cause damage to the environment.</p>

<b><p>Who can commit an environmental offence?</b></P>
<p>More than one person can commit an environmental offence in any situation, including:</P>
<ul><li><p>the person responsible for the action </li>
<li><p> a company or organisation, including contractors </li>
<li><p> managers, supervisors and directors</li>
<li><p> public authorities.</li></ul>

<b><p>Can an organisation be responsible for offences committed by someone else?</b></p>
<p>Yes. An organisation can be legally responsible for offences committed by agents, contractors or employees.</p>

<b><p>What should we do to prevent liability for environmental offences?</b></p>
<p>It is important for an organisation to have an environmental management system in place which identifies the environmental risks associated with the organisation’s operations and implements systems to prevent those risks from eventuating.</p>

<b><p>What are the enforcement mechanisms of the RMA?</b></p>

<p><ul><li><b><p>Infringement notices</b> are instant fines for low level type offences and can be issued on the spot (like parking tickets) by council officers.</p></li></p>

<p><li><b><p>Abatement notices</b> require a person to cease an activity or to take steps to avoid, remedy or mitigate adverse effects on the environment.  Abatement notices can be issued by a council against the person causing the problem or against the owners or occupiers of the land, or against all of them.</li></p>

<p><li><p>Where the council is uncertain as to the adequacy of an abatement notice, an <b>enforcement order</b> can be sought from the Environment Court.  Enforcement orders are used, for the most part like injunctions (i.e. to stop an activity).  Individuals and companies can also apply for enforcement orders from the Court.</li></p>

<p><li><p>Generally, <b>prosecutions</b> will only be considered where an incident has caused irreparable damage. A prosecution carries the potential of a fine of up to $300,000 for an individual and up to $600,000 for a company, as well as the liability for clean up costs and, in the most serious of cases, a maximum of two years' imprisonment.* </li></p></ul>

<p>*A  further fine up to $10,000 per day can be imposed for continuing offences.</p>
