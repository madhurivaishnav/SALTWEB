					<h3>Resource Consents / Designations</h3>
					
<p><b>What is a resource consent?</b></p>
<p>There are few activities which do not  require some form of resource consent. District and regional plans determine which activities are permitted, and which activities will require a resource consent before they can be carried out. The plans also set out the considerations to be applied to any resource consent application. </p>

<b><p>What are the categories of activities?</p></b>
<ul><li><p>Permitted Activity – no resource consent needed.</li>
<li><p>Controlled Activity – the council must grant consent but can impose certain conditions</li>
<li><p>Limited Discretionary Activity – the council’s ability to refuse consent is limited to certain factors</li>
<li><p>Discretionary Activity – an activity contemplated as suitable in the zone but subject to suitability of site; the council has open discretion to grant/refuse consent.</li>
<li><p>Non-Complying Activity – an activity not contemplated as suitable in the zone but not prohibited.</li>
<li><p>Prohibited Activity – no resource consent is available for these activities.</li></ul>

<b><p>What is the process for obtaining a resource consent?</b></p>
<p>An application is made to the appropriate local authority for a consent to undertake an activity. In general terms, district councils deal with land use and subdivisions, and regional councils deal with air and water discharges, and coastal marine activities.</p>
<p>The council will then decide whether to grant or refuse its consent to the application based on the relevant criteria in the council’s district/regional plan. The application may be notified before the council makes a decision to grant or refuse. This means that those parties likely to be affected by the proposed activity are given an opportunity to make submissions in support of or against the proposal. Only a small (but growing) minority of applications are notified.</p>
<p>There are rights of appeal to the Environment Court against a decision to refuse a resource consent or against particular conditions imposed on the consent by the local authority.</p>
<p>Where a resource consent application is publicly notified, an applicant has the ability to request their application be heard directly in the Environmental Court, leap-frogging the local authority process.  The local authority must give their consent to this process.</p>
