					<h3>Introduction and Background</i></h3>
					

<p>On 1 March 2008, the <i>Dangerous Goods Safety Act 2004 (WA) (the Act)</i> and its associated regulations came into effect.</p>

<p><b><u>How does the Act relate to other legislation?</b></u></p>
<p>The Act was passed on 10 June 2004 but did not come into force until a series of <b>seven new supporting regulations</b> were drafted and approved. These regulations address issues relating to major hazard facilities, storage, handling of non explosives, and security risk substances. They were approved on 31 December 2007.</p>
<p>The Act and its associated regulations replaced the <i>Explosives and Dangerous Goods Act 1961 (WA)</i> and<i> Dangerous Goods (Transport) Act 1998 (WA).</i></p>

<b><p><u>Which regulations are most relevant to your organisation?</u></b></p>
<p>The three supporting regulations to the Act which are <B>most relevant</b> are the:
<ol><li><p>Dangerous Goods Safety (Storage and Handling of Non-explosives) Regulations 2007</li>
<LI><P>Dangerous Goods Safety (Road and Rail Transport of Non-explosives) Regulations 2007</li>
<LI><P>Dangerous Goods Safety (Explosives) Regulations 2007.</li></p></ol>

<b><p><u>Objectives of the Act</u></b></p>
<p>The Act updates the legislation regulating the way that dangerous goods must be stored, handled and transported in Western Australia. It also introduces stricter licensing requirements for companies that handle dangerous goods. </p>

<p><b><u>What is the purpose of the Act?</u></b></p>
<p>The Act is designed to <b>shift the responsibility</b> for the management of dangerous goods <b>from government to private industry.</b> It adopts a ‘risk management' approach to dangerous goods and incorporates performance-based standards and codes of practice. The Act places a <b>general duty on companies to minimise risks</b> associated with dangerous goods which may affect <b>people, property and the environment.</b> It requires industry participants to take all reasonably practicable measures to manage these risks. </p>

<p><b><u>Which matters are covered by the Act?</b></u></p>
<ul><LI><P>General duties as to dangerous goods</li>
<LI><P>Regulations and codes of practice</li>
<li><p>Exemptions</li>
<li><P>Administration</li>
<LI><P>Investigation and enforcement</li>
<LI><P>Legal proceedings</li>
<LI><P>Miscellaneous issues.</li></ul></p>

<p><b><u>Who administers the Act?</b></u></p>
<p>The Resources Safety Division within the Western Australian Department of Mines and Petroleum (the Department) administers:
<ul><li><p>the <i>Dangerous Goods Safety Act 2004 (WA)</i> </li>
<li><p>the Dangerous Goods Safety Regulations 2007 (WA) supporting the Act.</li></p>
</ul>
<p>The Department is responsible for issuing licences, inspecting storage sites, facilities and vehicles used for transporting dangerous goods, and responding to incidents and complaints.</p>

<b><p><u>What are dangerous goods?</u></b></p>
<p>Dangerous goods are special category of hazardous substances and articles that have the potential to cause <b>immediate harm</b> to<b> people, property</b> and the <b>environment</b>. The focus of the definition of dangerous is on the <b>ACUTE</b> effect of these substances. The Western Australian dangerous goods safety legislation covers nine classes of dangerous goods, based on their hazardous properties, some of which are further divided into divisions. These are labelled accordingly. There are also goods too dangerous to transport and C1 combustible liquids.</p>
