Other Notes:
If you add another Upgrade script like say upgrade 4.1.1 to 4.2.0.sql then need to alter stuff in SALT\DatabaseConfiguration\App.config
a) key ApplicationName - change to correct version "Salt 4.2.0"
b) key NewVersionID - change to correct version "Salt 4.2.0"
c) for each currentversion need to add a step to include the new upgrade script so following <Step Description="Upgrading 4.1.0 TO 4.1.1" Script="Upgrade 4.1.0 to 4.1.1.sql"></Step> need to add <Step Description="Upgrading 4.1.1 TO 4.2.0" Script="Upgrade 4.1.1 to 4.2.0.sql"></Step>
d) Need to add a new currentversion so that the upgrade script will be run ie: add a currentversion id="Salt 4.1.1" and steps to run the upgrade script then views functions procedures etc.
