<h3>Quick Fact Sheet - Introduction to Money Laundering</h3>

 

 

<p><b>What is money laundering?</b></p>

<p>It is the process through which money obtained through criminal activities is given the appearance of having come from a legitimate source.</p>

<p><b>Why is money laundered?</b></p>

<p>Money is laundered in order to:</p>

<ul>

<li>Avoid prosecution</li>

<li>Increase profits</li>

<li>Avoid seizure of accumulated wealth</li>

<li>Appear legitimate</li>

<li>Evade taxes</li>

</ul>

<p><b>What problems are associated with money laundering?</b></p>

<ul>

<li>Undermining of the financial system</li>

<li>Expansion of crime</li>

<li>Increased threat of terrorism</li>

</ul>

<p><b>What is the FTR Act?</b></p>

<p>The FTR Act is currently the federal government's principal legislation aimed at preventing money laundering.  It imposes requirements on "cash dealers" in terms of account and signatory identification, reporting and document retention.</p>

<p><b>Who does the FTR Act apply to?</b></p>

<p>The FTR Act applies to all "cash dealers", which include banks, credit unions, insurers and reinsurers, casino operators, securities and foreign exchange dealers, TABs and so on.</p>

<p><b>Who enforces the FTR Act?</b></p>

<p>The FTR Act is administered by AUSTRAC, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre.  AUSTRAC reports information relating to money laundering and other breaches of the FTR Act to the Australian Taxation Office and law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>There are three stages in money laundering: placement, layering and integration.  The money laundering process does not always use all three stages - sometimes money is successfully laundered in one or two steps.</p> 

<p>Criminals may have assistance from financial, legal or other professionals at any or all stages of money laundering.</p>

<p><b>Placement</b> refers to the introduction of illegally obtained funds into the legitimate financial system.  Techniques used in placement include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Smurfing and structuring</li>

<li>Alternative remittances</li>

<li>Bulk movement</li>

<li>Electronic Funds Transfers</li>

<li>Asset conversion</li>

<li>Gambling</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Layering</b> is the movement of the money around the financial system, through several accounts in many different counties, in order to disguise its origins. Techniques used in layering include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Electronic Funds Transfers</li>

<li>Offshore Banks</li>

<li>Shell Corporations</li>

<li>Trusts</li>

<li>Walking Accounts</li>

<li>Intermediaries</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Integration</b> is the stage in which successfully laundered funds are made available once again to the criminal or syndicate.  Techniques used in integration include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Haven credit and debit cards</li>

<li>Consulting or directors' fees</li>

<li>Corporate financings</li>

<li>Real estate purchase and sale</li>

<li>Stock purchase and sale</li>

<li>Business recycling</li>

<li>Import/export transactions</li>

<li>Free trade zones</li>

</ul>
